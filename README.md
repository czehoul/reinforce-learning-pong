# Reinforce Learning to Solve Pong Atari Game
Explore Deep Reinforment Learning by solving Pong Atari Game with several reinforcement learning algorithm 

## PongDeepQLearning.py
- Solving Pong with Deep Q Learning 
- Some of the codes are taken from Thomas Simonini's Deep Reinforment Learning Couse (I highly recommend his course if you want to explore reinforment learning). I have adapted the code to Pong problem and using Tensorflow highlevel API - Keras, eager execution and custom training loop.    

## PongPolicyGradient.py
- Solving Pong with Policy Gradient
- I implemented this sometime ago with Tensorflow layer API based on a talk in Google IO 2017, some of the code is taken from  
Andrej Karpathy's GitHub

## To Be Done:
- Implement A2C algorithm to combine the advantages of Q Learning and Policy Gradient approach
